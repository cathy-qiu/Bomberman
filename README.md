Bomberman is a classic game first released in 1987 by developer Hudson Soft. The gameplay featured a character walking around a top-down arena with impassable walls in a grid formation and bricks between them.

Bomberman has went through many different interpretations with different gameplay features and goals. The version of Bomberman that we decided to create was a two-player battle arena version in which players using different buttons on the same keyboard try to trap and explode each other with their bombs to win. The players would load in on opposite sides of the arena and advance towards the center by destroying the destructible bricks to eventually fight in the middle
